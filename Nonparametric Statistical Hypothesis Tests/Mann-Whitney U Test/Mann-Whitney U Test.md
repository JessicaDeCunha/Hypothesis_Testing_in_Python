#  Mann-Whitney U Test

Tests whether the distributions of two independent samples are equal or not.

## Assumptions

- Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
- Observations in each sample can be ranked.

## Interpretation

- H0: the distributions of both samples are equal.
- H1: the distributions of both samples are not equal.

# Results

Statistic = 4885.000, p = 0.390
Probably the same distribution
