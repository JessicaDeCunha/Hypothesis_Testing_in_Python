This section lists statistical tests that you can use to check if your data has a Gaussian distribution.

## Anderson Darling Test

Anderson-Darling Test is a statistical test that can be used to evaluate whether a data sample comes from one of among many known data samples

It can be used to check whether a data sample is normal. The test is a modified version of a more sophisticated nonparametric goodness-of-fit statistical test called the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

A feature of the Anderson-Darling test is that it returns a list of critical values rather than a single p-value. This can provide the basis for a more thorough interpretation of the result.

### Assumptions

Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
Interpretation

H0: the sample has a Gaussian distribution.
H1: the sample does not have a Gaussian distribution.
