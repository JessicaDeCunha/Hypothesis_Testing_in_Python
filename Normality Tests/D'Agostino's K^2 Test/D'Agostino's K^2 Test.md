This section lists statistical tests that you can use to check if your data has a Gaussian distribution.

# D'Agostino's K^2 Test

The D’Agostino’s K^2 test calculates summary statistics from the data, namely kurtosis and skewness, to determine if the data distribution departs from the normal distribution.

Objective: Tests whether a data sample has a Gaussian distribution.

## Assumptions

Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).

## Interpretation

H0: the sample has a Gaussian distribution.
H1: the sample does not have a Gaussian distribution.
