# Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation

The Speakman's Rank Tests whether two samples have a monotonic relationship. A monotonic relationship is a relationship that does one of the following: 

1. as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other variable; or 
2. as the value of one variable increases, the other variable value decreases.

Spearman's correlation measures the strength and direction of monotonic association between two variables. 

## Assumptions

- Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
- Observations in each sample can be ranked.

## Interpretation

H0: the two samples are independent.
H1: there is a dependency between the samples.

## Results

Statistic = 0.048, p = 0.638
The two samples are likely independent
