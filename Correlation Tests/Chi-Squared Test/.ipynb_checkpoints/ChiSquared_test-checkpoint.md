# Chi-Squared Test

Tests whether two categorical variables are related or independent.

## Assumptions

Observations used in the calculation of the contingency table are independent.
25 or more examples in each cell of the contingency table.

## Interpretation

H0: the two samples are independent.
H1: there is a dependency between the samples.

# Results

probability=0.950, critical=653.903, stat=197.317
Independent (fail to reject H0)

Statistic = 197.317, p = 1.000
Independent (fail to reject H0)
