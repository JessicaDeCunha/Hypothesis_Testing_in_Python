# Augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit Root Test

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test determines whether a time series has a unit root. The intuition behind a unit root test is that it determines how strongly a time series is defined by a trend.

## Assumptions

Observations in are temporally ordered.

## Interpretation

H0: a unit root is present (series is non-stationary).
H1: a unit root is not present (series is stationary).

# Results

Statistic = -7.158, p = 0.000
Likely Stationary
