#  Studentâ€™s t-test

This section lists statistical tests that you can use to compare data samples.
Tests whether the means of two paired samples are significantly different.

## Assumptions

- Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
- Observations in each sample are normally distributed.
- Observations in each sample have the same variance.
- Observations across each sample are paired.

## Interpretation

- H0: the means of the samples are equal.
- H1: the means of the samples are unequal.

# Results

stat=-0.748, p=0.456
Probably the same distribution
